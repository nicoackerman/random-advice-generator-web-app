## Usage

Even though the idea of this project (and its design) isn't mine I found this idea very useful to spread joy. This web site was built in order to, not just to give random advices, but to entertain and get someone's smile. Subsequently, the next images are proof of this.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Typescript
- npm and Nodejs
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Advice slip json API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) -  For random advices
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - for states and components 
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### After making this project 

I've forward expectations on: focusing on state management with Redux or Zustand; Making a style version of this project using only CSS; and improving accessibility features on other projects, for instance traduction or screen-reader optimizations.
